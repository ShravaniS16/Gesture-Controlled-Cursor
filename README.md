# Gesture-Controlled-Cursor
This Python script uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to enable hand gesture control for the mouse cursor. The index finger moves the cursor, while a thumb-index pinch performs clicks. It includes smooth cursor movement, click delay prevention, and visual feedback. Perfect for hands-free interaction.
